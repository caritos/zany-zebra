## Getting Started

### How do I join a tennis club?

Browse available clubs in the Clubs tab, tap on a club to view details, then tap 'Join This Club' to become a member. You'll need to be signed in to join clubs.

### Do I need to pay to use Play Serve?

Play Serve is free to use! There are no subscription fees or hidden charges. Individual clubs may have their own membership fees, which are separate from the app.

### Can I join multiple clubs?

Yes! You can join as many clubs as you'd like. This is great if you play at different locations or want to connect with various tennis communities.

## Finding and Playing Matches

### How do I find someone to play with?

There are several ways:

- Check 'Open Invites' in your club to see who's looking for matches

- Use 'Schedule a Match' to create your own invite

- View club rankings to find players at your skill level

- Connect with players after recording matches together

### What's the difference between 'Record Match' and 'Schedule a Match'?

• 'Record Match': For logging a match you've already played

- 'Schedule a Match': For posting an open invite to find players for future matches

### How do open invites work?

When you schedule a match, it creates an open invite visible to all club members. Other players can accept your invite, and you'll be notified when someone wants to play. Invites expire after 7 days.

### Can I play singles and doubles?

Yes! Play Serve supports both singles and doubles matches. When recording or scheduling a match, you can specify the format you want to play.

### How do I find members in my club?

Use the Members tab in any club to browse all club members. You can sort and filter members to find ideal playing partners based on your preferences.

### What are the sorting options in the Members tab?

You can sort club members by:

- **Name**: Alphabetical order (A-Z)

- **Wins**: Most wins first (great for finding competitive players)

- **Matches**: Most active players first (members who play frequently)

- **Recent**: Recently joined members first (newest members)

### What are the filter options in the Members tab?

You can filter club members by activity level:

- **All**: Shows every club member

- **Active**: Shows members with 3+ matches played (experienced, regular players)

- **New**: Shows members who joined in the last 30 days (great for welcoming newcomers)



Active members have an 'ACTIVE' badge, and new members have a 'NEW' badge for easy identification.

### What do the member statistics show?

Each member's card displays:

- **Total matches played** in this club

- **Total wins** in this club

- **Win rate percentage** calculated from their match history

- **Color-coded progress bar**: Green (60%+ win rate), Orange (40-59%), Red (<40%)

- **Join date** when they became a club member



This helps you find players at your skill level or playing style preference.

### How do I filter matches in the Matches tab?

The Matches tab provides simple filtering options:

- **Type**: Filter by match format (All, Singles, or Doubles)

- **Date**: Filter by time period (All Time, Last Week, or Last Month)



These filters help you quickly find specific matches or review recent club activity.

## Rankings and Scoring

### How do rankings work?

Rankings are calculated based on:

- Match wins (100 points per win)

- Win streaks (up to 200 bonus points)

- Consistency (100 bonus points for 60%+ win rate)

- Activity (up to 150 points based on matches played)

- Small penalties for losses to encourage competitive play



Rankings are updated immediately after each match and are specific to each club.

### What happens to my ranking if I don't play for a while?

Rankings are based on your recent match history. If you're inactive for an extended period, your ranking points may decrease, encouraging active participation in the community.

### Are singles and doubles ranked separately?

Currently, rankings combine both singles and doubles results. Your overall performance across all match types determines your club ranking.

### What are provisional rankings?

Provisional rankings are for players with fewer than 5 matches in a club. They're indicated by a '*' symbol and appear at the bottom of the rankings list. This includes:

- New club members with 0 matches

- Players with 1-4 matches



Once you play 5 matches, you'll establish a non-provisional ranking and compete for top positions. Provisional players may see larger ranking changes as the system learns their skill level.

## Community Guidelines

### What are the community standards?

• Be respectful to all players

- Show up for scheduled matches

- Record scores honestly

- Maintain good sportsmanship

- Keep club facilities clean

- Follow individual club rules

### What if someone doesn't show up for a scheduled match?

If a player repeatedly no-shows, report this to club administrators. Clubs may have their own policies for handling no-shows.

### Can I dispute a match result?

If there's a disagreement about scores, try to resolve it with the other player first. For persistent issues, contact your club administrator for assistance.
