### **🗄️ Database Architecture Simplification (August 2025)**
**Complete SQLite Removal & Supabase-Only Architecture**

**Problem Solved**: Eliminated architectural confusion from dual-database system (SQLite + Supabase) that was causing developer confusion and maintenance complexity.

**Key Changes**:
- **Removed SQLite Entirely**: Deleted all SQLite database files, schemas, and related utilities
- **Simplified Services**: Updated all services (auth, clubs, matches) to use Supabase exclusively
- **Cleaned Dependencies**: Removed `expo-sqlite` package and all related imports
- **Unified Data Layer**: All data operations now flow through Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies
- **Component Simplification**: Removed SQLite-dependent hooks and badge systems that weren't essential

**Files Removed** (15+ files):
- `database/database.ts` and related SQLite setup files
- `services/offlineQueue/` directory (SQLite-dependent offline system)
- `hooks/useQuickActions.ts`, `hooks/useClubBadges.ts` (SQLite-dependent features)
- Obsolete test files and utility scripts

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All data flows through Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Simplified Development**: No more dual-database complexity or sync issues
- **Better Performance**: Direct Supabase queries without local database overhead
- **Easier Maintenance**: One database system to manage and secure

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Core functionality intact, codebase significantly simplified

### **🚀 v1.0.1 Release Preparation (January 2025)**

Comprehensive system for claiming matches with unregistered players:
- Inline "unregistered" buttons directly next to player names
- Confirmation dialogs with identity verification ("Are you 'PlayerName'?")
- Automatic unregistered player detection
- Atomic database updates
- Support for both singles and doubles matches
- Smart position-aware claiming
- **Documentation**: `/docs/features/match-claiming-system.md`

#### **Match Display Space Optimization (August 18, 2025)**
Major space efficiency improvements achieving 30-40% vertical space reduction:
- Removed redundant Singles/Doubles labels (obvious from player count)
- Eliminated inconsistent "Tennis Club" headers
- Compressed padding and spacing throughout
- Consolidated edit and notes icons in top-left corner
- **Documentation**: `/docs/ui-improvements/match-display-space-optimization.md`

## Technical Improvements

### **Database & Sync Issues**
- Fixed multiple authentication and database sync issues
- Improved data consistency and error handling

### **Onboarding Optimization**

- Enhanced reliability and coverage
- Comprehensive test panel development for new features

## Development Philosophy

### **Root Cause Analysis**
> "Always find the root cause of the problem rather than getting a fix that does not fix the source"

This principle guides all debugging and problem-solving approaches in the project.

### **Production Quality Focus**
- Enhanced app store readiness with proper configuration
- Systematic release preparation through GitHub issues
- Comprehensive documentation for all major features

### **User Experience Priority**
- UI/UX decisions focus on reducing cognitive load
- Grouping related functionality by user intent rather than technical implementation
- Consistent visual hierarchy and encouraging user interactions

## Debugging Resources

### **Log Management**
- Expo logs available at `logs/expo.log`
- Use subagent to tail at least 200 lines and return relevant lines for debugging

### **Documentation References**
All major features and implementations have corresponding documentation in the `/docs/` directory, organized by category (features, ui-improvements, testing, etc.).
