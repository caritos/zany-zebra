# Implementation Progress Log

## Issue #3: Core Database & Authentication Setup
**Status**: BLOCKED - Requires Supabase dashboard access
**Priority**: High (MVP Core)

### Problem
This issue requires:
1. Access to Supabase dashboard to create tables
2. Supabase admin permissions to set up RLS policies
3. Environment configuration that I cannot access

### Current State
- ✅ All SQLite schemas are complete and working
- ✅ Authentication is functional with email/password
- ❌ Supabase tables need to be created to match SQLite schema
- ❌ RLS policies need to be implemented for production security

### Recommendation
**Developer needs to:**
1. Access Supabase dashboard
2. Create tables matching SQLite schema in `/database/database.ts`
3. Set up RLS policies as documented
4. Test sync functionality with proper permissions

### Documentation Created
- Complete database schema documentation exists
- RLS policy templates can be provided
- Migration scripts can be generated
