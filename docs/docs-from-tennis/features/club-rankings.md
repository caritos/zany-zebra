# Club Rankings System Documentation

## Overview
The club rankings system provides competitive leaderboards for each tennis club, using a comprehensive points-based algorithm that rewards wins, consistency, and activity.

## Features

### Visual Elements
- **Trophy Icons**: üèÜ (1st), ü•à (2nd), ü•â (3rd) for top players
- **Provisional Badge**: "P" indicator for players with <5 matches
- **Win-Loss Records**: Clear display of match statistics
- **Win Percentage**: Calculated and displayed for each player

### Ranking Algorithm

#### Points Calculation
```typescript
Total Points = Base Points + Bonuses - Penalties

Where:
- Base Points: 100 √ó wins
- Win Streak Bonus: (totalWins / totalMatches) √ó 200
- Consistency Bonus: 100 (if win% ‚â• 60%)
- Activity Bonus: min(150, totalMatches √ó 10)
- Loss Penalty: 20 √ó losses
```

#### Sorting Logic
1. Primary: Total points (descending)
2. Secondary: Win percentage (descending)
3. Tertiary: Total matches played (descending)

### Provisional Status
- Players with fewer than 5 matches are marked provisional
- Indicated by "P" badge next to ranking number
- Encourages minimum participation for official ranking

services/matchService.ts

getClubLeaderboard(clubId: string): Promise<Array<{
  playerId: string;
  playerName: string;
  stats: PlayerStats;
  ranking: number;
  points: number;
  isProvisional: boolean;
}>>
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Get all players with matches in a club
SELECT DISTINCT 
  CASE 
    WHEN player1_id IS NOT NULL THEN player1_id
    ELSE player2_id
  END as player_id,
  users.full_name as player_name
FROM matches 
LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = player_id
WHERE club_id = ? 
  AND (player1_id IS NOT NULL OR player2_id IS NOT NULL)
```

### Type Definitions
```typescript
interface RankedPlayer {
  playerId: string;
