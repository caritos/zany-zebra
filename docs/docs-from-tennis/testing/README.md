## Testing Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic Testing
npm run test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Run with coverage report

# Advanced Testing Infrastructure
npm run test:orchestrate:smoke      # Quick smoke tests
npm run test:orchestrate:full       # Complete test suite
npm run coverage:monitor           # Real-time coverage monitoring
npm run coverage:gateway           # CI/CD coverage gate

# End-to-End Testing
npm run e2e                    # Run E2E tests
npm run e2e:contact-sharing    # Specific E2E test

# Monitoring and Analysis
npm run test:monitor           # Intelligent test monitoring
npm run coverage:analyze      # Coverage analysis
```

## Testing Infrastructure Overview

The testing system consists of:

1. **Unit Tests** - Component and service testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Full user journey testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Maestro-based UI testing
4. **Coverage Monitoring** - Real-time coverage tracking
5. **Test Orchestration** - Intelligent test execution
6. **Intelligent Monitoring** - Automated issue detection

## Key Features

- **100% Coverage Goal** - Comprehensive coverage monitoring and analysis
- **Intelligent Automation** - Automatic issue detection and resolution
- **Multiple Test Strategies** - Smoke, regression, full, CI, and release testing
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Live coverage and quality tracking
- **Quality Scoring** - Beyond just coverage percentages
- **CI/CD Integration** - Coverage gates and automated validation
- **Visual Reports** - HTML, Markdown, and JSON reporting
- **Historical Trends** - Track coverage and quality over time

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the testing environment**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run coverage:baseline
   ```

2. **Run your first comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:orchestrate:smoke
   ```

3. **Start monitoring coverage**:
   ```bash
   npm run coverage:monitor
   ```

4. **Review generated reports** in `tests/reports/`

## Best Practices

1. **Write tests first** - TDD approach recommended
2. **Focus on quality** - Not just coverage percentages
3. **Use monitoring tools** - Leverage intelligent automation
4. **Regular maintenance** - Monitor trends and address regressions
5. **Team responsibility** - Make testing a shared practice

## Troubleshooting

For common issues:
1. Check the intelligent monitor logs
2. Review generated fix guides in `tests/reports/`
3. Consult the troubleshooting sections in the detailed guides
4. Use the monitoring patterns for issue identification

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing patterns and conventions
2. Ensure comprehensive coverage of new features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Run the full test suite before committing
