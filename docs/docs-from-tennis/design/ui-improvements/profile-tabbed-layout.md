# Profile Page Tabbed Layout Enhancement

## Date: August 18, 2025

## Overview
Redesigned the profile page with a tabbed layout to better organize content and improve user experience. The previous single-page layout was becoming lengthy and overwhelming, so content has been reorganized into focused tabs.

## Problem Statement
- Profile page was getting too long with all sections stacked vertically
- Users had to scroll extensively to find specific information
- Content lacked logical grouping and organization
- Settings and personal info were mixed together
- Club memberships information was redundant with main Clubs tab

## Solution Implementation

### New Tab Structure
Created a 4-tab layout with focused content areas:

1. **Profile Tab** - Essential user information
   - User email and phone display
   - Edit Profile button
   - Clean, minimal interface

2. **Stats Tab** - Tennis performance data
   - Complete PlayerStatsDisplay component
   - Win/loss records, percentages
   - Singles and doubles breakdowns

3. **Matches Tab** - Match history
   - MatchHistoryView component with actual opponent names
   - Club context included in match displays
   - Chronological match listing

4. **Settings Tab** - App preferences and support
   - FAQ / Help navigation
   - Privacy Policy link
   - Contact Support button (new feature)
   - Sign Out functionality

### Removed Redundant Content
- **Club Memberships tab** - Removed as this information is available in main Clubs tab
- Eliminated duplicate functionality and navigation

### Added Contact Support Feature
- New Contact Support button in Settings tab
- Opens default email app with pre-filled support template
- Includes device information and user context
- Replaces scattered email addresses throughout documentation
- Professional support flow following iOS best practices

## Technical Implementation

### Tab Navigation System
```javascript
type TabType = 'profile' | 'stats' | 'matches' | 'settings';

// Tab bar with icons and active state
<TouchableOpacity
  style={[styles.tab, activeTab === 'profile' && { borderBottomColor: colors.tint }]}
  onPress={() => setActiveTab('profile')}
>
  <Ionicons name={activeTab === 'profile' ? 'person' : 'person-outline'} />
  <ThemedText>Profile</ThemedText>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Contact Support Integration
```javascript
const handleContactSupport = async () => {
  const supportEmail = 'eladio@caritos.com';
  const subject = 'Tennis Club App Support Request';
  const body = `Pre-filled template with device info and user context`;
  
  const emailUrl = `mailto:${supportEmail}?subject=${encodeURIComponent(subject)}&body=${encodeURIComponent(body)}`;
  await Linking.openURL(emailUrl);
};
```

### Header Design
- Prominent user name display at top
- Clean separation between header and tab content
- Consistent with club detail page design patterns

## User Experience Benefits

- **Reduced friction** - One-tap access to support

### Enhanced Usability

- **Icon clarity** - Meaningful icons for each tab
- **Reduced scrolling** - Content fits better on screen

## Layout and Styling

### Tab Bar Design
```javascript
tabBar: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  borderBottomWidth: 1,
},
tab: {
  flex: 1,
  flexDirection: 'column',
  alignItems: 'center',
  paddingVertical: 12,
  borderBottomWidth: 2,
  borderBottomColor: 'transparent',
  gap: 4,
},
```

### Content Organization
- Each tab contains focused, related content
