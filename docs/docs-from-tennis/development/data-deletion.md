# Data Deletion Request

If you would like to delete your Tennis Club account and associated data, you have several options:

## Delete Account Through App

The easiest way to delete your account is through the Tennis Club app:

1. Open Tennis Club app
2. Go to **Profile** tab
3. Tap **Settings** (gear icon)
4. Tap **Account Settings**
5. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
6. Tap **Delete Account**
7. Confirm your decision

Your account and personal data will be deleted within 30 days.

## Request Deletion by Email

If you cannot access the app, you can request account deletion by email:

**Send your request to**: privacy@tennisclub.app

**Include in your email:**
- Your full name as registered in the app
- The email address associated with your account
- Your phone number (for verification)
- Clear statement: "I request deletion of my Tennis Club account and all associated personal data"

We will process your request within 30 days and send you confirmation when complete.

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete your account, we remove:

### Immediately Deleted
- Your personal profile information (name, email, phone)
- Your account credentials and login access
- Your club memberships and rankings
- Your match invitation history
- Your notification preferences

### Anonymized and Retained
Some data may be anonymized and retained for legitimate business purposes:
- **Match Results**: Scores may be anonymized (removing your name) to preserve ranking integrity for other players
- **Community Reports**: Safety reports are retained in anonymized form to protect the community
- **Analytics Data**: Usage statistics that cannot be traced back to you individually

### Permanent Retention
The following data is permanently retained for safety and legal compliance:
- **Banned User Records**: If your account was banned for violations, this record is kept to prevent re-registration
- **Legal Compliance**: Data required for legal or regulatory purposes

## Data Deletion Timeline

- **Account Access**: Immediately disabled upon deletion request
- **Personal Information**: Removed within 30 days
- **System Cleanup**: Complete removal from backups within 90 days
- **Confirmation**: Email notification when deletion is complete

## After Deletion

Once your account is deleted:

### You Cannot
- Access your Tennis Club account
- Recover your match history or rankings  
- Restore your club memberships
- Retrieve any personal data that was deleted

### You Can
- Create a new account with the same email address (if desired)
- Rejoin tennis clubs you were previously in
- Start fresh with new rankings and match history

## Important Notes

### Deletion is Permanent
Account deletion cannot be undone. Make sure you're certain before proceeding.

### Match History Impact
Your match results may remain as anonymized data to preserve other players' ranking integrity. For example, "Player beat Anonymous Player 6-4, 6-2" instead of showing your name.

### Other Players' Data
We cannot delete your information from other players' personal records (like saved contact information or personal messages outside the app).

### Third-Party Services
If you used Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In, you may need to revoke Tennis Club's access through your Apple ID or Google account settings.

## Alternative: Account Deactivation

If you're not ready for permanent deletion, consider:
- Simply not using the app (your data remains but account becomes inactive)
- Leaving individual clubs while keeping your account
- Updating your privacy settings to limit data sharing

## Questions or Problems?

If you have trouble deleting your account or questions about the process:

**Email**: privacy@tennisclub.app  
**Subject**: Account Deletion Request

We typically respond within 2 business days and will help resolve any issues with the deletion process.
