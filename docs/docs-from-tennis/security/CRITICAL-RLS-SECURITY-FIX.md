# CRITICAL: RLS Security Vulnerability Fix Required

## üö® SECURITY ALERT: Immediate Action Required

Your Supabase database has **critical security vulnerabilities** that expose user data:

### Tables Missing Row Level Security (RLS):
- ‚ùå `public.reports` - User reports are publicly accessible
- ‚ùå `public.blocked_users` - User block lists are publicly accessible

## Impact
**HIGH SEVERITY**: These tables contain sensitive user data that is currently accessible to anyone with API access.

- **Reports table**: Contains user dispute reports, safety complaints, and moderation data
- **Blocked users table**: Contains user blocking relationships and privacy preferences

## Immediate Fix Required

### 1. Apply Security Migration
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will apply migration `20250826150000_fix_critical_rls_security.sql` which:

- ‚úÖ Enables RLS on both vulnerable tables
- ‚úÖ Creates proper access policies
- ‚úÖ Adds security constraints
- ‚úÖ Adds performance indexes

### 2. Migration Contents

```sql
-- Enable RLS (Critical Security Fix)
ALTER TABLE public.reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.blocked_users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Reports Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own reports" ON public.reports
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = reporter_id OR 
    auth.uid() = reported_user_id
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can create reports" ON public.reports
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = reporter_id);

-- Blocked Users Policies  
CREATE POLICY "Users can view blocks they created" ON public.blocked_users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = blocker_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create blocks" ON public.blocked_users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = blocker_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own blocks" ON public.blocked_users
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = blocker_id);

-- Prevent self-blocking
ALTER TABLE public.blocked_users 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_no_self_block 
CHECK (blocker_id != blocked_user_id);
```

## Security Model After Fix

### Reports Table
- ‚úÖ Users can only view reports they filed or reports filed against them
- ‚úÖ Users can only create reports where they are the reporter
- ‚úÖ Users cannot modify existing reports (audit trail integrity)
- ‚úÖ No unauthorized access to other users' report data

### Blocked Users Table
- ‚úÖ Users can only view their own block list
- ‚úÖ Users can only block other users (not themselves)
- ‚úÖ Users can unblock users they previously blocked
- ‚úÖ No access to other users' blocking relationships

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test RLS Status
```bash
node scripts/test-rls-security.js
```

### 2. Manual Verification
After migration, test these queries should fail for unauthorized access:

```sql
-- Should fail: trying to access other users' reports
SELECT * FROM reports WHERE reporter_id != auth.uid();

-- Should fail: trying to access other users' blocks  
SELECT * FROM blocked_users WHERE blocker_id != auth.uid();
```

### 3. Authorized Access Should Work
```sql
-- Should succeed: own reports
SELECT * FROM reports WHERE reporter_id = auth.uid();

-- Should succeed: own blocks
SELECT * FROM blocked_users WHERE blocker_id = auth.uid();
```

## Performance Impact
‚úÖ **Minimal** - Indexes added for RLS query performance:
- `idx_reports_reporter_id`
- `idx_reports_reported_user_id` 
- `idx_blocked_users_blocker_id`
- `idx_blocked_users_blocked_user_id`

## Compliance & Safety
This fix ensures:
- ‚úÖ **GDPR Compliance**: Users can only access their own data
- ‚úÖ **Privacy Protection**: Block lists remain private
- ‚úÖ **Safety Features**: Report system maintains confidentiality
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Report integrity preserved

## Timeline
‚è∞ **URGENT**: Apply this migration immediately to secure user data.

## Rollback Plan
**‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER**: Only rollback if absolutely necessary, as it will disable security:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.reports DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.blocked_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- (Plus drop all policies)
```
