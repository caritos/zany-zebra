# RLS Security Status - RESOLVED âœ…

## Security Fix Applied Successfully

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Critical RLS vulnerabilities fixed

### Issues Fixed
- âœ… **Reports Table**: RLS enabled with proper access policies
- âœ… **Blocked Users Table**: RLS enabled with proper access policies

### Verification Results

**Anonymous Access Test**: âœ… **PASSED**
- Reports access properly restricted
- Blocked users access properly restricted
- No unauthorized data exposure

### Security Model Now Active

#### Reports Table (`public.reports`)
- âœ… Users can only view reports they filed OR reports filed against them
- âœ… Users can only create reports where they are the reporter

- âœ… Users can only block other users (self-blocking prevented)
- âœ… Users can unblock users they previously blocked
- âœ… Complete privacy of blocking relationships

### Performance Optimizations Applied
- âœ… Indexes created for RLS query performance:
  - `idx_reports_reporter_id`
  - `idx_reports_reported_user_id`
  - `idx_blocked_users_blocker_id` 
  - `idx_blocked_users_blocked_user_id`

### Compliance Achieved
- âœ… **GDPR Compliance**: Users can only access their own data
- âœ… **Privacy Protection**: Block lists remain private
- âœ… **Safety Features**: Report system maintains confidentiality
- âœ… **Data Integrity**: Audit trails preserved
