# TODO - Project Task List

## Authentication Features

### âœ… Login/Signup System
- [x] Created login screen with email/password fields
- [x] Auto-detection of existing users (login vs signup)
- [x] Profile table syncs with auth.users table
- [x] Email confirmation disabled for immediate access
- [x] Navigation to home screen after successful auth

### ðŸ”„ Forgot Password Feature
**Status**: Partially Implemented - Needs Supabase Configuration

#### What's Completed:
- [x] "Forgot Password?" link on login screen
- [x] Link only enabled when valid email is entered
- [x] Email validation before sending reset request
- [x] Integration with Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail` API
- [x] Created reset-password screen for in-app password reset
- [x] Password validation (min 6 chars, matching passwords)
- [x] Success/error handling with user feedback
- [x] Deep linking configuration in app.json
- [x] AuthProvider handles deep link URLs


#### What's Not Working:
- [ ] **Supabase Hosted Password Reset Page Not Loading**
  - Email sends successfully
  - Link in email shows API error: "No API key found in request"
  - Not redirecting to Supabase's hosted password reset page
  - Deep linking to app not functioning as expected

#### Required Supabase Dashboard Configuration:
1. **Authentication â†’ URL Configuration**:
   - Set Site URL (currently missing/misconfigured)
   - Add redirect URLs for web-based reset
   
2. **Authentication â†’ Email Templates**:
   - Verify "Reset Password" template is enabled
   - Ensure template uses `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`

3. **Authentication â†’ Providers â†’ Email**:
   - Confirm email provider is enabled
   - Check email confirmation settings

#### Next Steps:
1. Configure Supabase dashboard properly for hosted password reset
2. Test email flow with proper redirect URLs
3. Consider implementing custom password reset page if hosted page issues persist
4. Add password strength requirements UI feedback

#### Files Modified:
- `/app/login.tsx` - Added forgot password functionality
- `/app/reset-password.tsx` - Created password reset screen
- `/app/_layout.tsx` - Added routing for reset-password
- `/contexts/auth.tsx` - Added deep link handling
- `/app.json` - Updated URL scheme for deep linking

#### Testing Instructions:
1. Enter valid email in login screen
2. Click "Forgot Password?" (should be enabled)
3. Check email for reset link
4. Click link (currently shows API error)
5. Expected: Should open Supabase hosted page or deep link to app
